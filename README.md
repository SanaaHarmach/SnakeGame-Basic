# SnakeGame-Basic

This is a simple beginner version of Snake game that has no styling. Looking forward to leveling it up by adding some styling to it and extra features to make the game more fun to play.

This is a great project for those of you who have never touched code before or those of you with some basic understanding of JavaScript, that would like to go over the fundamentals again.

# The in-built JavaScript methods used
In this game of Tetris I used the following inbuilt JavaScript methods:


  * addEventListener()
  * querySelector()
  * querySelectorAll()
  * keyCode()
  * Math.floor()
  * Math.random()
  * length
  * forEach()
  * pop()
  * unshift()
  * clearInterval()
  * setInterval()
  * push()
  * classList.add()
  * classList.remove()
  * classList.contains()
